# Coffee Machine

## Description
  - What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? Two cups. Press a couple of buttons on the machine, and, voilà, a burst of raw energy is in your hands. But first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on a coffee machine simulator. This machine uses regular ingredients — coffee, milk, and plastic cups. Should it run out of something, it will show you a notification. Our device will serve espresso, cappuccino, and latte. And since nothing is for free, it will also charge coffee lovers for a cup.

## Objectives
  - Write a program that puts some basic information on the screen: Let the machine describe what it takes to make a cup of coffee!
  - Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.
  - Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.
  - Teach your virtual coffee machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.
  - Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.
  - Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.
