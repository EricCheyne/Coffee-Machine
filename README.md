# Coffee Machine

## Description

What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it.

The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

## Objectives

### Stage 1: Make a first cup

Put some basic information on the screen: let the machine describe what it takes to make a cup of coffee!

### Stage 2: Calculate the ingredients

Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.

### Stage 3: Estimate the number of servings

Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.

### Stage 4: Add functions to your machine

Teach your virtual coffee machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.

### Stage 5: Keep track of the supplies

Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.

### Stage 6: Brush up the code

Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.
